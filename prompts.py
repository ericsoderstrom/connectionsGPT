followed by a newline followed by sure/maybe/impossible. Use 'sure' conservatively, only when you are 100 percent certain that the four words match the category descriptor.

A daisy, rose, tulip, and violet are all flowers.
sure

Although LILY PAD, MOUSE PAD, and MAXI PAD are all in-the-language phrases, PAN PAD is not.
impossible
